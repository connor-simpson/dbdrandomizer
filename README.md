## Setup

At the moment, there is four versions of the randomizer:

Killers (horizontal) randomizer
Killers (vertical) randomizer
Survivors (horizontal) randomizer
Survivors (vertical) randomizer

In OBS, create a new browser scene, and enter the URL of the desired layout you'd like to use. You'll need to enable both 'Shutdown source when not visible' and 'Refresh browser when scene becomes active'.

When you show/hide the browser scene, a 10 second 'spin' will begin and then the entity will select the suvivor/killer. The screen will stay on the selected survivor/killer until you show/hide the scene again.

You can have a look at what it looks like on OBS here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMXeUJ3xBus

It's completely free, and I'm hopefully going to get around to doing random perks as well.
